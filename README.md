# Room-Occupancy-Detection

<b>Abstract</b>:<p> Experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature,Humidity,Light and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute.</p>

<b>Attribute Information:</b>

Temperature, in Celsius/Kelvin/Fahrenheit <br>
Relative Humidity, % <br>
Light,<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux">in Lux</a> <br>
CO2, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation">in ppm</a> <br>
Humidity Ratio, Derived quantity from temperature and relative humidity, in kgwater-vapor/kg-air <br><br>
<b> Result</b>
<p>Occupancy, 0 or 1, 0 for not occupied, 1 for occupied status</p>
